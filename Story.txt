Years ago, a hacker called “Loop” marked crimes with that symbol.
They vanished before Arin ever caught them.
Now the symbol was back—brighter, bolder.
Loop wanted him involved.
But why steal the microchip?

Arin zoomed into the footage and traced the loop’s curvature.
The lines angled at 45°, 90°, and 135° on the frame grid.
Another set of numbers—another pattern.
Loop was never random.
Every stroke meant something.
