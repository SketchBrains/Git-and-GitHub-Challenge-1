Arin recorded the rhythm on paper like Morse notes.
The ticks aligned into the numbers 3 and 2.
Every five-second segment repeated the same cycle.
A clue hidden inside meaningless noise.
He sensed a deliberate breadcrumb trail.

He checked the archive logs around 3:02 AM.
A single camera had glitched at that exact moment.
Before cutting out, it captured a faint symbol on the wall.
An infinity loop scribbled in chalk.
A calling card he’d seen once before.
