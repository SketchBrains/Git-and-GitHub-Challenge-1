Detective Arin Malik stood in the Grand Archive, staring at the empty pedestal.
The stolen item—a microchip rumored to hold a national secret—was priceless.
No alarm rang, no glass was broken.
The thief had moved like smoke.
Only a charred USB drive remained.

Inside it was a short audio clip: a ticking sound.
Arin played it until he felt a pattern repeating.
Three slow ticks, two quick ones.
Someone wanted him to hear this.
This was no ordinary theft—it was an invitation.
