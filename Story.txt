Using the three angles, Arin plotted them as coordinates on a city map.
They pointed to an old clock tower by the river.
A perfect playground for puzzles.
The tower was sealed years ago.
But Arin had keys to forgotten places.

Inside, dust floated like ghosts.
Arin climbed the spiraling stairs and found chalk marks.
Lines, arrows, circles, all forming a maze.
In the center lay a note: “Time reveals all.”
Below it—three disconnected gears.
