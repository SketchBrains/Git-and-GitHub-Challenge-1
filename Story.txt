Arin followed the breadcrumbs to an abandoned subway line.
Graffiti arrows led him deeper underground.
His footsteps echoed through forgotten tunnels.
The air smelled of rust and burnt wires.
Something hummed ahead.

He found a metal case in the center of the tunnel.
As he approached, a projector activated.
Loop’s distorted voice filled the darkness.
“Finish the sequence, detective.”
The case remained locked, waiting.
